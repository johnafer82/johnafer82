👋 Hi, I’m @johnafer82
👀 I’m interested in AI-powered solutions, large language models (LLMs), and building tools that make AI accessible for everyone. I’m also passionate about fitness, especially kettlebell training and running.
🌱 I’m currently learning Flutter as I develop and refine my platform, PlugginAI — a tool that helps businesses integrate AI chatbots seamlessly into their websites.
💻 My platform PlugginAI.org focuses on making AI simple, effective, and practical for small businesses looking to improve customer engagement.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to AI integration, mobile app development, and building intuitive websites with AI functionality.
🛠 I enjoy exploring large language models (LLMs) and finding ways to integrate them into real-world solutions for businesses.
⚡ Fun fact: When I’m not coding or working on AI, you’ll probably find me working out with kettlebells or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.
